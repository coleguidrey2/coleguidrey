  <h1> Tesla's Brand </h1>
  <h2> April 2024 </h>
  <article>
  <p>
  Tesla, the name synonymous with electric vehicles, ignited the electric revolution, with cutting edge technology and coolness. Tesla’s reign as the darling EV maker has hit turbulence, faulty range claims, full-self-driving questions, and tweets, but a more corrosive threat is more subtle: the deterioration of Tesla’s brand.
  </p>
  <p>
  Tesla revealed the roadster to an exclusive audience of 350 tech enthusiasts and investors. The roadsters release in July of 2006 marked the first limited capacity full electric sports car. It was a strategic success, exciting investor interest and providing the cash to fund the production of the Model X sedan released six years after.
  </p>
  <p>
  Their descending entry strategy forged Tesla’s image as a luxury automaker. Its designs were sleek, tech focused, and the cars had insane torque. Its scarcity only added to its mystique. This was a car of your rich uncle, or that one eccentric neighbor. Tesla’s brand was all style, luxury, and futurism.
  </p>
  <p>
  Style is so important to Tesla’s success because it made the EV cool. Before tesla, there was Prius and its painfully meek design. Teslas captured interest with its sleek curves, and minimal interiors. But after the release of the Model 3, and Model Y, Tesla’s style has stagnated.
  </p>
  <p>
  Tesla entered mass market with their affordable EVs, the Model S, and Model 3. Cutting costs with materials and manufacturing, a majority of sales comes from this segment. Their cars are now a common part of traffic. Their insistence on volume sacrificed their luxury appeal, and wekeaned its pricing power with its high-end Models, that have the best margins.
  </p>
  <p>
  They rely too much on futurism.  The consumer becomes accustomed to novelty quickly.; Robot vacuums and robot food delivery is now standard. Their futuristic theatrics work well for investors, but has little impact on the consumers. If futurism stays a tenet of the brand, consumers will be  underwhelmed.
  </p>
  <p>
  So where does Tesla go from here? Tesla cannot survive as the low cost player, Asia is too competetive. They must reestablish their products as the most beautiful on the road. More timely model refreshes and elevated designs are necessary. The maintenance and upkeep of the vehicles should be easy. Still the only direct to consumer auto manufacturer, and travelling service, diffferentiates Tesla. They must nurture and improve upon this advantage.
